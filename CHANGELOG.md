- Breaking Changes
    - directives are no longer automatically applied to local function calls, '@hug.local' must be used to apply them
    - cli_behaviour has been removed as a type feature - however common sense inheritance of base types should easily replace it's usage
    - documentation module has been removed, in favor of documentation being generated by the api object and individual interfaces
    - API singleton now has sub-apis for each interface in use (IE hug.API(__name__).http and hug.API(__name__).cli)
    - run module has been removed, with the functionality moved to hug.API(__name__).http.server() and the terminal functionality
      being moved to hug.development_runner.hug
