"""hug/__init__.py

Everyone needs a hug every once in a while. Even API developers. Hug aims to make developing Python driven APIs as
simple as possible, but no simpler.

Hug's Design Objectives:

- Make developing a Python driven API as succint as a written definition.
- The framework should encourage code that self-documents.
- It should be fast. Never should a developer feel the need to look somewhere else for performance reasons.
- Writing tests for APIs written on-top of Hug should be easy and intuitive.
- Magic done once, in an API, is better then pushing the problem set to the user of the API.
- Be the basis for next generation Python APIs, embracing the latest technology.
